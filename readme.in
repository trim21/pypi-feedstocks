# pypi conda mirrors

release some pypi packages to conda ecosystem

you can find packages at these channels:

- <https://anaconda.org/pypi-mirrors/repo> (recommended)
- <https://prefix.dev/channels/pypi-mirrors> (daily mirrored from previous channel)

## policy

- Only pure python package, which means it has `*-py3-none-any.whl` wheel on pypi so we do not need to build anything.
- If a package is also packed by conda-forge, we will drop it from here
