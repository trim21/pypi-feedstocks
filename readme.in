# pypi conda mirrors

release some pypi packages to conda ecosystem

<https://prefix.dev/channels/pypi-mirrors>

## policy

- Only pure python package, which means it has `*-py3-none-any.whl` wheel on pypi so we do not need to build anything.
- If a package is also packed by conda-forge, we will drop it from here
